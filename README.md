# 🌩️ AWS Cloud Security Projects

This repository is a collection of hands-on **AWS security labs and projects** completed as part of my cloud cybersecurity learning journey.  
Each project focuses on real-world security tasks including:

- Vulnerability analysis  
- Systems hardening  
- IAM security  
- Network firewalling  
- EC2 monitoring  
- Data encryption  
- CloudTrail log investigation  

The goal is to demonstrate **practical, job-ready cloud security skills** relevant to roles such as:
